# personal-win-tweaks
kinda just stole a reg file from an article i read a while ago and edited it.
mostly comprised of some tweaks that make a huge difference in cpu performance but a few niceties too.

savitarax's youtube channel brought the "processor performance time check interval" setting in powersettingsexplorer to my attention, which when setting to the max already yielded a huge bump in performance. a while later i noticed a bunch more settings like that and decided to fiddle with them lol. now im beating a 4770k in a bunch of benchmarks with just a heavily undervolted 4790 and some nasty fast ram; windows now actually puts up a fight against linux w/ a custom kernel in my testing. pretty insane that this was potentially completely looked over.
